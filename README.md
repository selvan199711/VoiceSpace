# VoiceSpace
Capstone - HTTP-5310

VoiceSpace is a location-based audio app where people leave short voice messages at real places. Other people can hear these messages only if they go to the same location.
There are no profiles, no likes, and no scrolling feed. Users discover voices by walking around instead of browsing on a screen. When someone is nearby, the app lets them know and they can listen to what was left there.
Voice messages in VoiceSpace do not expire. Once a voice is added to a place, it stays there permanently unless it is removed by moderation. This allows locations to collect stories, memories, and opinions over time.
The goal of this project is to show how voice and location can be used to create a simple, human way for people to share messages that belong to a place.
